# ZigZag conversion (Ascii)
This is a kind of Ascci converter - dedicated to drawing / cutting machines.
This short code convert a image (called moon.jpg in the code) into lines.
Brightness of the image is converted to zigzag on the lines, amplitude of the zigzag depends of the brightness of the pixel.

This code is used to obtain the lines to export to a Gcode for a laser printer, drafter etc.

Sample is given with a picture of the moon.
Output picture is saved as Moon.tif, and line coordinates are saved into .csv file
CSV file allows user to push it into Gcode (after some adjustment) to go IRL on your printer etc.

Have fun !
